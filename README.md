## Project Overview
This project consists of user inputed data to create five food trucks.
This data consists of the truck names, food types, and ratings.

After the user input, a menu is generated.

    Users can choose between viewing:  
 1) the inputed food truck data,
 2) the average truck ratings,
 3) the highest-rated truck,
 4) and a quit option that displays a "good-bye" message when selected.
